### Hi there, I'm Brad ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’³ By day, I work as a Software Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). I've previously done similar stints at [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com) and [Etsy](https://etsy.com).

ðŸ“¸ A long time ago, I co-authored software for photographers in the form of [SlideShowPro](https://slideshowpro.net) and [Koken](https://koken.me).

âš’ In my limited spare time, I'm building [Nokkio](https://nokk.io), an early stage development platform for modern web applications.
